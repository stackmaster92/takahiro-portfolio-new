export const ABOUT_TEXT =
  `Hi there! I'm Takahiro Hiroshi, a passionate Full-Stack & AI Developer with over 10 years of experience designing and delivering scalable digital solutions. Based in Tokyo, Japan, I focus on building high-performance applications that seamlessly integrate front-end and back-end systems.

  Over my career, I've specialized in backend engineering with Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI) and Node.js, while also enjoying frontend development with React, Vue.js, Angular, and Next.js. I architect robust APIs (REST & GraphQL), design data pipelines (ETL, SQL optimization), and work with modern databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis. 

  My expertise extends to AI/NLP (spaCy, transformers, PyTorch, TensorFlow, GPT APIs), blockchain (Solidity, web3.js), and DevOps/cloud infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Jenkins). I enjoy creating solutions that not only function efficiently but also scale for long-term success.

  What drives me is solving complex problems—whether it's fine-tuning large language models, streamlining data workflows, or automating deployments to the cloud. I believe in clean, maintainable code, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and building tools that empower teams.

  Outside of coding, I’m passionate about exploring the latest in AI, cloud technologies, and automation. I'm always learning, improving, and eager to take on new challenges. Let’s collaborate and build impactful software together!`;
